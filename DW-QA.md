# Data Warehouse

The core purpose of a data warehouse is to integrate and store large amounts of internal and external data, providing accurate, reliable data for analysis, reporting, and decision-making, while addressing issues like **fragmentation**, and difficult historical data management.

## Q1. Data Warehouse Architecture - Hourglass

Built a layered data warehouse (ODS > DIL > DML > DAL) to ingest, clean, and transform data into fact and dimension tables. Defined data domains, granularity, metrics, and embedded business logic for subject-oriented, multi-dimensional analysis

</div>

## Q2. How is your data warehouse built?

### 1. Architecture

We follow a **business-driven layered architecture**: **ODS → DIL/DIM → DWS → ADS**.

- **ODS**: Ingest raw data via binlog subscription with hourly batch loading.  
- **DIL/DIM**: Clean, deduplicate, and normalize data; build fact and dimension tables.  
- **DML (Data Mart Layer)**: Perform <mark>subject-oriented</mark> modeling around <mark>business entities</mark> (e.g., Merchant, Order) and processes (e.g., Top-up, settlement, payment/withdrawal), delivering reusable wide tables and standardized metrics for **<mark>multi-dimensional and thematic analysis.</mark>**
- **ADS (Application Data Service Layer)**: Deliver application-level wide tables to support Finance, Risk, and BI reporting.  

### 2. Modeling

#### Business Case 1 – Cross-border E-commerce Collection

- **Process-oriented**: Model fact tables around fund flow processes:  
  *Top-up → Distribution → Withdrawal/Payment/Subscription.*  
- **Entity-oriented**: Build subject tables around merchants, shops, and orders.  
  Design metrics to enable multi-dimensional analysis, subject-area analytics, and monitoring of core business KPIs.  

#### Business Case 2 – Cross-border Remittances

- **Process-oriented**: Model fact tables around the remittance lifecycle:  
  *Sender initiates transfer → Remittance → Recipient account setup → Recipient collects funds.*  
- **Entity-oriented**: Build subject tables around sending institutions, remittance orders (3 lifecycle stages), recipients, and senders.  
  Design metrics to support funnel analysis, compliance monitoring, and business insights.  

### 3. Governance

- **Data Asset Scoring**: Evaluate each table across four dimensions: standards, data quality (DQC), security, and cost.  
- **Data Quality Monitoring (DQC)**: Enforce rules for completeness, uniqueness, timeliness, and reconciliation.  
- **Security & Compliance**: Detect unencrypted sensitive fields and enforce ownership accountability.  

### 4. Development Process：

1. Defined business goals and requirements.
2. Collected data into ODS and integrated into fact and dimension tables (DIL/DIM).
3. Organised data domains, determined data granularity, and designed key metrics.
4. Abstracted business and data subject analyses into DML tables.
5. Delivered reporting, supporting subject-specific and multi-dimensional analysis

## 2. Data Governance - Data Asset Score

**🔹 Background & Motivation**

> Rapid growth of payments business exposed chaos in our Hive/Spark data layer: inconsistent table names, missing comments, unmanaged dependencies, quality checks, security compliance, or cost inefficiencies.

> Previously, only Data Quality Checks (DQC) were used to evaluate data assets. In this project, expansion of the Data Asset Scoring mechanism by introducing 3 new dimensions:
> Table Standards (35%) & Security (15%) & Cost (15%)  **Combined with DQC (35%)**, we built a comprehensive 100-point scoring system that evaluates the usability, reliability, compliance, and cost-efficiency of data assets.

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Goals & Expected Benefits</strong></summary>  
Updating the Data Asset Scoring framework (0–100 points) to quantify each table’s:

1. Table Standards (35%): naming, comments, dependency hygiene
2. Data Quality Checks (35%): SLA‑driven timeliness, DQC rule coverage, alert management
3. Security (15%): sensitive‑field encryption & owner compliance
4. Cost (15%): compute and storage cost

</details>
  
<details>
<summary><strong>⚙️ Design & Implementation</strong></summary>

1. Scoring Rules automated via SparkSQL jobs running daily;
2. Table (names, comments, dependencies) extracted from Hive Meta Table & Lineage Relationship Table.
3. DQC rules stored and versioned in a rule table, evaluation output is written into a DQC_Score table.
4. Security – Perform sensitive‑field encryption checks using the scan results supplied by the data-security‑platform team
5. Cost – Implemented by our Data Platform team via daily scans for stale/“garbage” tables and by defining table lifecycle stages. Each day’s cost evaluation output is written into a Cost_Score table.
6. Whitelist Mechanism allows table owners to apply for temporary exemptions.
7. Finally, together the scores from all four dimensions, applied our weighted formula, and loaded the consolidated score into the central Data Asset Score table.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚀 Push via Platform & Automation & Manual configuration</strong></summary>

- ✅ Enforced **naming conventions** for all new tables through platform-level **constraints** in the visual table-creation process
- ✅ **Auto-configured** zero-record checks and primary key uniqueness constraints  
- ✅ Enhanced **whitelist governance**, preventing exempt tables from impacting scoring  
- ✅ **Excluded** temporary tables prefixed with `temp_`, `tmp_`, or `check_` from evaluation scope

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 Results : Average asset score improved from 77+ → 86+</strong></summary>

> Overall Health Improvement
> On a 100‑point scale, portfolio of tables has moved from the “C+” range up into the “B+” range—meaning that, on average, assets now meet governance criteria (naming standards, DQC coverage, security and cost controls).

</details>

> 🌱 Future Extensions: Incorporate data‑usage heatmaps & Add partition‑level DQC quality checks.

## 3. ToB Business - Cross-border E-commerce Collection and Payout

> Background:
>
> - Under the standard collection model, Shopee currently only supports local settlement of sales proceeds—meaning funds from sold goods can only be settled into local overseas bank accounts.
> - However, for **cross-border sellers, it is not feasible to open overseas bank accounts**. As a result, sellers face challenges in **receiving payments and accessing their earnings freely**.
> - Ten-Pay is great at getting money back to China and distributing it efficiently.

So, Provide offshore accounts (AS Shopee official wallet) and **fund repatriation** services `[riːˌpætriˈeɪʃən]` for Shopee cross-border sellers based in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and South Korea.

**Subject-Specifc Analysis model**

> covering `Sending Institution (Remittance Providers)`, `Orders`, and `Users`.

1. **Sending Institution (SI)** : Analysed key metrics (countries, currencies and transaction, user volumes, fees, FX income ...), produced reports of transaction & profits to guide improvements.
2. **Orders** : 3 stage life-cycle funnel to measure conversion rates and bottleneck. - Order status: A: Provider order | B: Account opening process | C:  Complete fund receipt.
3. **Users** : basic info, behaviour, life-cycle, preferences for targeted campaigns.


**Regulatory Reporting** 

In cross-border inbound remittance to China, user orders are recorded individually (1-to-1), while actual fund settlements arrive in batches. For regulatory reconciliation—especially under HK MSO, MAS MPI, or SAFE/PBoC oversight—we ensure each fund batch (gather_result_list) is accurately matched to valid user orders (remit_list). This ensures auditability, mitigates AML risks, and enables accurate compliance reporting.
