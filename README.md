# Data Warehouse Solutions

The core purpose of a data warehouse is to integrate and store large amounts of internal and external data, providing accurate, reliable data for analysis, reporting, and decision-making, while addressing issues like **fragmentation**, and difficult historical data management.

## 1. Data Warehouse Architecture - Hourglass

Built a layered data warehouse (ODS > DIL > DML > DAL) to ingest, clean, and transform data into fact and dimension tables. Defined data domains, granularity, metrics, and embedded business logic for subject-oriented, multi-dimensional analysis

<details>
<summary>üí°Why Layered Design?</summary>

Dimensional Modeling
  It follows the principle of data layering (e.g., DIL, DML), which enables clear separation of concerns between raw data integration and subject-oriented analysis.

> - Clarifies responsibilities across layers (e.g., raw events vs. analysis-ready data)  
> - Supports atomic and aggregated metrics  
> - Improves reusability and maintainability  
> - Aligns with modern data warehouse best practices (e.g., Kimball methodology)
> - üß≠ Industry Terminology ‚Äî DIL and DML follow the same layered logic as DWD/DWS in other companies. Naming may different, but all follow Kimball-style dimensional modeling.

data development processÔºö
1. Defined business goals and requirements.
2. Collected data into ODS and integrated into fact and dimension tables (DIL/DIM).
3. Organised data domains, determined data granularity, and designed key metrics.
4. Abstracted business and data subject analyses into DML tables.
5. Delivered reporting, supporting subject-specific and multi-dimensional analysis

## 2. Data Governance - Data Asset Score

**üîπ Background & Motivation**

> Rapid growth of payments business exposed chaos in our Hive/Spark data layer: inconsistent table names, missing comments, unmanaged dependencies, quality checks, security compliance, or cost inefficiencies.

> Previously, only Data Quality Checks (DQC) were used to evaluate data assets. In this project, expansion of the Data Asset Scoring mechanism by introducing 3 new dimensions:
> Table Standards (35%) & Security (15%) & Cost (15%)  **Combined with DQC (35%)**, we built a comprehensive 100-point scoring system that evaluates the usability, reliability, compliance, and cost-efficiency of data assets.

<details>
<summary><strong>üéØ Goals & Expected Benefits</strong></summary>  
Updating the Data Asset Scoring framework (0‚Äì100 points) to quantify each table‚Äôs:

1. Table Standards (35%): naming, comments, dependency hygiene
2. Data Quality Checks (35%): SLA‚Äëdriven timeliness, DQC rule coverage, alert management
3. Security (15%): sensitive‚Äëfield encryption & owner compliance
4. Cost (15%): compute and storage cost

</details>
  
<details>
<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Design & Implementation</strong></summary>

1. Scoring Rules automated via SparkSQL jobs running daily;
2. Table (names, comments, dependencies) extracted from Hive Meta Table & Lineage Relationship Table.
3. DQC rules stored and versioned in a rule table, evaluation output is written into a DQC_Score table.
4. Security ‚Äì Perform sensitive‚Äëfield encryption checks using the scan results supplied by the data-security‚Äëplatform team
5. Cost ‚Äì Implemented by our Data Platform team via daily scans for stale/‚Äúgarbage‚Äù tables and by defining table‚ÄØlifecycle stages. Each day‚Äôs cost evaluation output is written into a Cost_Score table.
6. Whitelist Mechanism allows table owners to apply for temporary exemptions.
7. Finally, together the scores from all four dimensions, applied our weighted formula, and loaded the consolidated score into the central Data Asset Score table.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üöÄ Push via Platform & Automation & Manual configuration</strong></summary>

- ‚úÖ Enforced **naming conventions** for all new tables through platform-level **constraints** in the visual table-creation process
- ‚úÖ **Auto-configured** zero-record checks and primary key uniqueness constraints  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced **whitelist governance**, preventing exempt tables from impacting scoring  
- ‚úÖ **Excluded** temporary tables prefixed with `temp_`, `tmp_`, or `check_` from evaluation scope

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìà Results : Average asset score improved from 77+ ‚Üí 86+</strong></summary>

> Overall Health Improvement
> On a 100‚Äëpoint scale, portfolio of tables has moved from the ‚ÄúC+‚Äù range up into the ‚ÄúB+‚Äù range‚Äîmeaning that, on average, assets now meet governance criteria (naming standards, DQC coverage, security and cost controls).

## 3. ToB Business - Cross-border E-commerce Collection and Payout

> Background:
>
> - Under the standard collection model, Shopee currently only supports local settlement of sales proceeds‚Äîmeaning funds from sold goods can only be settled into local overseas bank accounts.
> - However, for **cross-border sellers, it is not feasible to open overseas bank accounts**. As a result, sellers face challenges in **receiving payments and accessing their earnings freely**.
> - Ten-Pay is great at getting money back to China and distributing it efficiently.

So, Provide offshore accounts (AS Shopee official wallet) and **fund repatriation** services `[riÀêÀåp√¶triÀàe…™ É…ôn]` for Shopee cross-border sellers based in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and South Korea.

### Subject-Specifc Table

**Subject-Specifc Analysis model**, covering `Merchant`, `Shop`, and `Orders`.

From churn monitoring to cross-site transaction trend analysis, comprehensive dashboards and thematic tables provide strong data support for business growth, product experience enhancement, and precision operations.


**Amazon**

- Merchant-level subject table: total recharge, lifecycle tags, retention.
- Shop-level subject table: site, platform, per-shop inflow/outflow, active vs inactive shops.
- Order-level subject table: transaction-level granularity for detailed analysis.

**Subject-Specifc Analysis model**

> covering `Sending Institution (Remittance Providers)`, `Orders`, and `Users`.

1. **Sending Institution (SI)** : Analysed key metrics (countries, currencies and transaction, user volumes, fees, FX income ...), produced reports of transaction & profits to guide improvements.
2. **Orders** : 3 stage life-cycle funnel to measure conversion rates and bottleneck. - Order status: A: Provider order | B: Account opening process | C:  Complete fund receipt.
3. **Users** : basic info, behaviour, life-cycle, preferences for targeted campaigns.


**Regulatory Reporting** 

In cross-border inbound remittance to China, user orders are recorded individually (1-to-1), while actual fund settlements arrive in batches. For regulatory reconciliation‚Äîespecially under HK MSO, MAS MPI, or SAFE/PBoC oversight‚Äîwe ensure each fund batch (gather_result_list) is accurately matched to valid user orders (remit_list). This ensures auditability, mitigates AML risks, and enables accurate compliance reporting.
