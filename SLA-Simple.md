## üß† SparkSQL - Optimisation Case

> **The following are simplified examples. The real situation is more complicated.**

### init SQL

```sql
SELECT
  t.institution,
  t.sender_country,
  t.currency,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t.transaction_id) AS tx_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS sender_count,
  SUM(t.amount * fx.fx_to_cnh) AS total_cnh,
  SUM(t.amount * fx.fx_to_usd) AS total_usd
FROM transactions t
JOIN exchange_rates fx ON t.currency = fx.currency AND t.fdate = fx.fdate
WHERE t.fdate BETWEEN '20240101' AND '20241231'
GROUP BY t.institution, t.sender_country, t.currency;
```
