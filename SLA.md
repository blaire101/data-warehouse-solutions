## üß† SparkSQL - Optimization Case

> **The following are simplified examples. The real situation is more complicated.**

### init SQL

```sql
SELECT
  t.institution,
  t.sender_country,
  t.currency,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t.transaction_id) AS tx_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT t.sender_id) AS sender_count,
  SUM(t.amount * fx.fx_to_cnh) AS total_cnh,
  SUM(t.amount * fx.fx_to_usd) AS total_usd
FROM transactions t
JOIN exchange_rates fx ON t.currency = fx.currency AND t.fdate = fx.fdate
WHERE t.fdate BETWEEN '20240101' AND '20241231'
GROUP BY t.institution, t.sender_country, t.currency;
```

| Data Skew in Remitting Countries | For example, transactions from the US exceed 12 million, accounting for 40%, causing severe skew in `group by + shuffle`. |
| Large Exchange Rate Table        | `exchange_rates` contains millions of daily records, causing high I/O during joins.                                       |
| COUNT DISTINCT Memory Pressure   | Multi-dimensional and multiple `COUNT DISTINCT` aggregations lead to memory spills and GC issues.                         |
| Improper Aggregate Type          | Default use of `HashAggregate` is prone to OOM under skewed data conditions.                                              |
